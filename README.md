# FAQ:
> How to Buy It?
- Add **TonicBoomerKewl#8349** on Discord (Me) to Buy.
> Can It Mod **iOS** Games?
- Maybe, if You Can *Somehow* Find An **iOS Emulator**. (I Can't)
> Can I have the Full List of Commands?
- Yes, Just Use the **Help (h)** Command to View the **Help Page** for the Full List of Commands.
> Is It **Detectable**?
- Avoid Detection By **Not** Editing Too Much Memory.
- Sometimes There Are **"Trap" Values**, & Games Can Detect if Such Values are Edited, & Either Ban You, or **Pretend to "Crash"**.
- Since **TonicGuardian** Edits From **Outside the Emulator**, the Game Cannot Detect **TonicGuardian** by Itself.

- Depends; The Game Can Encrypt Their Values & Hide Them, or Store Data on Server-Side.
- A Server-Sided Game May Still be Modded, If the Server Doesn't Perform **Sanity Checks**.
- With Enough Skill, Any Value Can be Decrypted, Since the Game Itself Needs Access to Its Own Values.
